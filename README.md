# Viewport FPS

This is a blender add-on that calculates minimum, maximum and average viewport FPS.

It is meant to be used to test the performance of other real-time add-ons.

## Installation

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/ScottishCyclops/viewport-fps/releases) on github and under _Assets_, choose the latest _viewport-fps-x.x.x.zip_.

> If you want the latest in-developpment version, which is not recommanded, you can go on the [master branch](https://github.com/ScottishCyclops/viewport-fps/tree/master) on github, then click the button that says _Clone or download_, then _Download ZIP_.

Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to find `viewport-fps.py`.

Open Blender, go into _Edit_, _Preferences..._, _Add-ons_, and click on _Install..._ at the top of the window.

Navigate to the folder where `viewport-fps.py` is, then double click on the file, or select it and click _Install Add-on from File..._

You should see the add-on in the list. If not, search for _viewport_ in the search box and it should pop up.

Click on the checkbox to enable it.

## Usage

You can access the tool from either the 3D Viewport, in the right menu (press _N_ to open), under _Tool_ > _Viewport FPS_.

Or alternatively you will find the same panel under the _Properties Panel_, in the first tab called _Active Tool and Workspace settings_.

## Bugs and suggestions

Please report any bugs or suggestions in the appropriated tab on the [Github page](https://github.com/ScottishCyclops/viewport-fps/issues).

## Conclusion

I hope you'll find this add-on useful and I am open to suggestions (regarding this addon, or ideas for addons) !
